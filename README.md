# Smart Way to Automate the Management of Parking System for Starring Building

## Project Overview
The **Smart Automated Parking Management System for Starring Building** is designed to address challenges in traditional parking facilities by integrating advanced technologies such as computer vision, augmented reality (AR), and blockchain. This system aims to enhance efficiency, reduce congestion, and provide a seamless user experience through automated parking slot detection, real-time navigation, vehicle identification, rule enforcement, and secure payment processing.

Modern urban environments require innovative solutions that optimize space usage, reduce congestion, and enhance user convenience. By integrating real-time data, automated systems can address these challenges and provide a seamless experience for users.


## Research Problem

Managing parking systems in modern urban environments has become increasingly complex due to the growing number of vehicles and the need for efficient, user-friendly solutions. Traditional parking facilities often struggle with several key challenges, including inefficient use of available space, reliance on manual enforcement of parking rules, and the lack of effective guidance for drivers seeking available slots. A key issue in traditional parking systems is the manual detection and enforcement of violations, which relies on human intervention and often results in unauthorized vehicles occupying spaces. This reduces availability for legitimate users and contributes to congestion as drivers search for open slots. Additionally, outdated payment systems cause delays during entry and exit, diminishing user satisfaction.

## Solution Overview 
> To address the challenges of traditional parking systems, our System integrates advanced technologies to address the challenges of traditional parking facilities,
> - **Automated License Plate Recognition**: Identifies vehicles entering the parking lot and assigns Parking IDs to manage access efficiently.
> - **Vehicle Classification**: Classify vehicles based on their size and type to optimize parking space usage.
> - **Real-time Parking Slot Detection**: Uses cameras to monitor slot occupancy and provide real-time updates.
> - **Augmented Reality Navigation**: Guides drivers to available parking slots through AR visual guidance via mobile app.
> - **Parking Violations and Fines Management**: Automatic detection and enforcement of parking violations and automatically issues fines.
> - **Blockchain-based Payment System**: Calculates parking fees based on time parked and payments are processed securely through mobile app, credit cards, and contactless payments.
